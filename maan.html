		<p class="gwal">Located at the North-east end of the fort, Man mandir palace was built between 1486 and 1516 by the Tomar ruler, Man Singh Tomar. The palace couldn't survive with time, however the remains of the palace still showcases the beautiful carvings and designs of that era.The palace has two open courts in between with apartments on two levels. There are underground prison cells as well, built later by Mughals. This was the place where Aurangzeb prisoned his brother Murad and poisoned him slowly to death by using opium. If you can find a local guide, he/she would be able to tell you various secrets about the place and show you various parts of the palace, which otherwise you won't be able to see. Nearby Jauhar Kund is the place where various Rajput women committed mass suicide to avoid rapes by the forces of Iltutmish who was the king of Delhi in the 13th century AD. The palace is also surrounded by other monuments like Jehangir Mahal, Shah Jahan Mahal and the Gujari Mahal.</p>
