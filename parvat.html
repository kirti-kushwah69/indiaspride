		<p class="gwal">The place is a hub of Jain temples. Holding hundreds of rock-cut Jain monuments, believed to be of the 7th to 15th century, this place has historical and religious importance as well. You can visit this place to see some of the unique sculptures of Jain Munis and Gods. Gopachal Parvat Jaina monuments are a group of Jain carvings dated to between 7th and 15th century. They are located around the walls of the Gwalior Fort, Madhya Pradesh. They depict Tirthankaras in seated Padmasana posture as well as standing Kayotsarga posture, in the typical naked form of Jain iconography. This group of Jain monuments is related to numerous others found in the north side of the fort including the Siddhachal Caves. The Gopachal rock cut monuments are a part of nearly 100 Jain monuments found in and around the Gwalior city, but these are dated earlier than the Siddhachal Caves located about 2 kilometers (1.2 mi) north of these monuments. Both monuments were defaced and desecrated around 1527 when Emperor Babur ordered their destruction. Centuries later, the Jain community restored many of the statues by adding back stucco heads on the top of the damaged idols. The prolific Apabhramsha author Raidhu was responsible for consecrating many of the Jain rock-carved images as attested by multiple inscriptions. These include the two colossal images of Shri Adinatha (57 feet) and Shri Chandraprabha.</p>
